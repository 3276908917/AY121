# AY121: 
Lukas' data and code hub.

To-do:

* Merge the plotter scripts
* Get latest edits from lab computers
* Update the Google doc
* Maintain a report folder? Ask the Professor how to do this in an ethical manner

* How easy is it to go up and down the file hierarchy in LaTeX? This will determine whether I may proceed under the current parallel directories res/ and report/

* Employ modular programming approach: split the scripts up into smaller scripts that can be imported at will.
	* You could even use the fat-simulator approach and import a for-convenience master script which imports the others.
