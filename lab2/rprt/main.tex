\begin{abstract}

We investigated the hyperfine hydrogen transition by calibrating our measurements to thermal noise and by averaging over many blocks of data taken in optimal time windows of the day. We investigated the speed of light using waveguides (\textcolor{red}{How do they work?}). Our Chi-Squared analysis is completely deficient because our data were taken too broadly to show noticeable inconsistencies.

This is a great place to have a to-do section, because I prefer to write abstracts at the end of the writing process.

\section{Introduction and Background}

Block diagram of the telescope electronics. Fortunately, it seems like the professor took care of most of this for you in lecture, February 11.

\section{Methods}

To place our test signal in the upper and lower sidebands, we use these two frequencies. To put the hydgrogen in the upper and lower sidebands, we set the first local oscillator to these other two frequencies.

\section{Results}

As a preface, I may want to include commentary on how I had to manually alter the data, based on readings from the oscilloscope, in order to account for the
