\textcolor{red}{We need more narrative drive. Consider using powerful transition phrases}

We investigated the hyperfine hydrogen transition by calibrating our measurements to thermal noise and by averaging over many blocks of data taken in optimal time windows of the day. We investigated the speed of light using waveguides (\textcolor{red}{How do they work?}). Our Chi-Squared analysis is completely deficient because our data were taken too broadly to show noticeable inconsistencies.

This is a great place to have a to-do section, because I prefer to write abstracts at the end of the writing process.

\quad * Ask Professor about the permissions thing (page 3), to make sure there are no technical difficulties.

\section{Introduction and Background}

\textcolor{red}{Block diagram of the telescope electronics}. Fortunately, it seems like the professor took care of most of this for you in lecture, February 11.

% Leave the waveguide equations for the `models' section

% 3. The equations for the two waveguides; scipy.optimize.fmin

The data that we sample from the Big Horn via the PicoScope will feature arbitrary units which depend on our setup. To calibrate the intensity of the spectrum, we first calculate the gain:

\begin{equation}
G = \frac{T_\text{sys, cal} - T_\text{sys, cold}}{\sum (s_\text{cal} - s_\text{cold})} \sum s_\text{cold} \approx \frac{\text{300 K}}{\sum (s_\text{cal} - s_\text{cold})} \sum s_\text{cold}
\end{equation}

Where $T_\text{sys, cal} \approx 98.6^\circ$ F $\approx 310$ K represents the temperature of the human flesh that we use to cover most of the telescope. $T_\text{sys, cold}$ represents the temperature of the cold sky. We expect $T_\text{sys, cold} \ll T_\text{sys, cal}$, whereby we get the approximated form on the right. $s_\text{cal}$ represents the spectrum for which we attempt to maximize thermal noise in the collector, and $s_\text{cold}$ represents the spectrum for which we attempt to minimize.

To remove constant sources of interference in our data, we take an `on-spectrum' where 
Line shape:

\begin{equation}
s_\text{line} = \frac{s_\text{on}}{s_\text{off}}
\end{equation}

Putting it all together:

\begin{equation}
T_\text{line} = s_{line} \times G
\end{equation}

For our first experiment with waveguides, we seek to calculate to calculate the wavelength $\lambda_\text{sl}$ of a signal inside the waveguide based on the positions of the minima in the squared voltage, which we call nulls. We use the following equation for this first experiment; we expect a linear dependence of null spacings on $\lambda_\text{sl}$.

To plot our calibrated spectrum against Doppler velocity, we use the following relation:
\begin{equation}
v = -c \frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu_0}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
x_m = A + m \frac{\lambda_\text{sl}}{2}
\end{equation}

$m$ is the index of the null, $x_m$ is the position of the null $m$, and $A$ represents a constant offset which can represent whether the far end of the waveguide is open or shorted.

X-band waveguide \textcolor{red}{(this one requires more motivation):}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:xband}
\lambda_g = \frac{\lambda_\text{fs}}{[1 - (\frac{\lambda_\text{fs}}{2a})^2]^{1/2}}
\end{equation}

$\lambda_g$ is the guide wavelength, which we directly measure. $\lambda_\text{fs}$ is the free-space wavelength of the signal, which we will calculate using the known input frequency and the relation $c = f \lambda_\text{fs}$. $a$ is the width of the waveguide.

Here we define reduced chi-squared as follows:

\begin{equation}
\chi_r^2 = \frac{1}{N - M} \sum_i \frac{|y_i - \hat{y_i}|^2}{\sigma_i^2}
\end{equation}

\section{Methods}

% We used local oscillators at these power levels and at these frequencies.

To place our test signal in the upper and lower sidebands, we use these two frequencies. To put the hydgrogen in the upper and lower sidebands, we set the first local oscillator to these other two frequencies.

We measure $\lambda_g$, the guide wavelength, as the distance between the nulls in the guide output. We measure $a$ with a set of calipers and compare this with our results from a least-squares fit to the data based on equation \ref{eq:xband}.

% For the cass. data, we switched the local oscillator powers

\section{Observations}

As a preface, I may want to include commentary on how I had to manually alter the data, based on readings from the oscilloscope, in order to account for the imbalance in picoscope inputs?? I think not!

% The times of observation and why that matters.

% 1. initial calibration results. Here is a test signal. ``Our setup works!''
% source of error: angles are not aligned well. 10% error becomes... 25%? in power plot. I do not remember.

% scrap for time: justify the use of mean vs median

% talk about changes in the power levels for the local oscillators

% 2. initial H1 observations: on-line and off-line, to get the line shape
% difference between mean and median

% scrap for time: it doesn't look like our Cass data actually need a polyfit. We can probably
% just assume that it's flat already

Additionally, the large central spike and smaller `bunny ear' spikes ($\pm$.5 MHz) appear on all data sets as persistent interference; we partially ignore these by limiting the y-axis. \textcolor{red}{Maybe you should use an initial test sample, to discuss this.}}

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:on_limits} shows a host of interfering signals, a consequence of the imperfections in our setup (such as low signal-to-noise ratio from low power on the local oscillators). \textcolor{red}{How can I justify ignoring the 2 MHz spikes? Aren't those bad?}

\section{Analysis}

% 1. The poly fit to the baseline

% 2. The Gaussian fits to the remaining curves

% 3. 

Since the Horn was pointing straight up, we may say that the declination is equal to the latitude of the telescope. In our case, that is $37.873199^\circ \approx 0.661012$ radians. The right ascension is equal to the local sidereal time (LST) of data-capture.

%I forgot when we did the cold sky data

We labeled all of our samples with unix times. Included below is a table including examples of date conversions to Doppler corrections for the events of interest. For the sake of brevity, we omit the counterparts for the Cassiopeia measurements.

The Doppler correction exhibits a critical time sensitivity. Observe that, just for one source (directly overhead), the final Doppler correction differed from the initial by about 550 m / s. \textcolor{red}{Okay. What now?}

\textcolor{red}{If I have extra space, put the results from the Cass. Doppler correction calculation}
