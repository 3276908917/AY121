\section{Introduction}

% I guess ?? is now the code I use to point out areas to which I need to return later.

Discussion on results for week 2, section 1

We used one signal generator (N9310A) with a wide range of allowed frequencies, while the other (83712B) with a lower frequency limit of 10 MHz. 

We set the 83712B to run at 11 MHz and 1.5 dBm (justify??). This gave $\Delta \nu = .05 \times \nu_{LO} = .55$ MHz. We set the N9310A to run at 1.5 dBm as well and, depending on the trial, either $\nu_{RF} = \nu_{LO} + \Delta \nu = 11.55$ MHz or $\nu_{RF} = \nu_{LO} - \Delta \nu = 10.45$ MHz. 

When collecting data, we sampled at 32.5 MHz, which is more than double the Nyquist frequency. ?? why is this important and give a calculation of how far above the Nyquist this is

\

?? I didn't identify the sum and difference frequencies from observation!!

$\sin(\nu_{LO} + \Delta \nu) = \sin \nu_{LO} \cos \Delta \nu + \cos \nu_{LO} \sin \Delta \nu$

$\sin(\nu_{LO} - \Delta \nu) = \sin \nu_{LO} \cos \Delta \nu - \cos \nu_{LO} \sin \Delta \nu$

\

But these are not relevant, we want

$sin(a) + sin(a + b) = ?$, right?

$\sin(\nu_{LO}) \sin(\nu_{LO} + \Delta \nu) = \frac{1}{2} (\cos \Delta \nu - \cos (2\nu_{LO} + \Delta \nu))$ by evenness of the cosine function

and

$\sin(\nu_{LO}) \sin(\nu_{LO} - \Delta \nu) = \frac{1}{2} (\cos \Delta \nu - \cos (2\nu_{LO} - \Delta \nu))$

Why do the power spectra look the way they do. Upper sideband and lower sideband.

For the upper sideband, we can see spikes at almost the difference frequency (.575 MHz $\approx$ .55 MHz). The other spikes are at 10.2 MHz? Why?

For the lower sideband, we see outer spikes at 9 MHz. The inner spikes are still at roughly the difference frequency...

\

First I need indices of maxima?

Recreate the original using Fourier filtering. I did NOT do this!!

Explain what you see.

%Consequently, we had to establish a frequency range such that $\nu_{LO} - \Delta \nu$ would st

\section{Some examples to get started}

\subsection{How to include Figures}

First you have to upload the image file from your computer using the upload link the project menu. Then use the includegraphics command to include it in your document. Use the figure environment and the caption command to add a number and a caption to your figure. See the code for Figure \ref{fig:frog} in this section for an example.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{frog.jpg}
\caption{\label{fig:frog}This frog was uploaded via the project menu.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{How to add Comments}

Comments can be added to your project by clicking on the comment icon in the toolbar above. % * <john.hammersley@gmail.com> 2016-07-03T09:54:16.211Z:
%
% Here's an example comment!
%
To reply to a comment, simply click the reply button in the lower right corner of the comment, and you can close them when you're done.

Comments can also be added to the margins of the compiled PDF using the todo command\todo{Here's a comment in the margin!}, as shown in the example on the right. You can also add inline comments:

\todo[inline, color=green!40]{This is an inline comment.}

\subsection{How to add Tables}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. 

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}

\subsection{How to write Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.


\subsection{How to create Sections and Subsections}

Use section and subsections to organize your document. Simply use the section and subsection buttons in the toolbar to create them, and we'll handle all the formatting and numbering automatically.

\subsection{How to add Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

You can upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with JabRef; or import your \href{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}{Mendeley}, CiteULike or Zotero library as a \verb|.bib| file. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

You can find a \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.

We hope you find Overleaf useful, and please let us know if you have any feedback using the help menu above --- or use the contact form at \url{https://www.overleaf.com/contact}!
