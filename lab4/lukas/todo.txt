F* assemble one single directory which contains the best available pointings for each
	angle on the range \ell \in [-9, 250]

$ Write script which provides abbreviation functions
	for quickly parsing and displaying data in a .fits file.

$ The error script should include the values of alt, az;
	and, for convenience, should include percent discrepancy
(currently we have only flat difference e.g alt - alt_actual)

Current problems:
    there are three separate clouds. Which one represents the true Doppler
    shift? Why not all of them? The problem is that we have an
    equation for V_Dopp as a function of R.
    
    
    We can get the doppler shift with respect to temperature by using
    1D interpolation scipy.interpolate.interp1d on the corrected dopper velocity 
    and have it fit the frequency function, which is also the same frequency function used with the temperatures.
    The frequency function for both velocity and temperature is based on the sampling rate of our telecope,
    using   t = 1/header["SAMPRATE"]
    
    It's basically graphing the velocity vs frequency and temperature vs frequency, to get at the end temperature vs velocity.
	
	We can use the Temperature vs doppler velocity function to calculate the HI density N_HI (function 3 in the lab handout)
    and Mass of HI M_Hi (function 7 in the lab handout) at any Galactic longtitude l, b=0. 
	
	To detect the spiral movements, We can make a 2d image using the Galactic longtitude as x axis, 
    Doppler Velocity as y axis and temperature as color. Grid[ Doppler velocity ][ Galactic longtitude ] = Temperature    
    and plot using plt.imshow(Grid)
	
	We can also create 2d image using the Galactic longtitude as x axis, density N of HI as y axis and Doppler velocity as input for color. 
    Grid[ Doppler velocity ][ Galactic longtitude ] = density N HI
    
    Then we can make a movie by ploting an image of 1 * 260 pixels where the y is Galactic Latitude = 0,
    y axis is Galactic longtitude from -10 to 250 degrees, 
    and the color shows how the density N_Hi is changing by moving the velocity from -200 km/s to 200 km/s
