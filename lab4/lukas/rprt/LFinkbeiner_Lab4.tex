We study

1. velocity patterns of various H clouds using Doppler shifts

2. black hole mass

3. accuracy of a spiral arm fit

results, uncertainties.

\section{Introduction and Background}

% However, I have not yet actually incorporated equation 8 into my analysis.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:spiral}
R_\text{arm} = R_0 e^{\kappa(\phi - \phi_0)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:vel_dopp}
V_\text{Dopp} = \left[ \frac{V(R)}{R} - \frac{V(R_\odot)}{R_\odot} \right] R_\odot \sin(\ell)
\end{equation}

We also want gain / calibration equations from lab 2.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:line_shape}
T_\text{line} = G \, \frac{s_\text{on}}{s_\text{off}}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation} \label{eq:line_gain}
G = \frac{T_\text{sys, cal} - T_\text{sys, cold}}{\sum{(s_\text{cal} - s_\text{cold})}} \sum{s_\text{cold}}
\end{equation}

Given certain patterns, how well does a spiral fit? We need to control for the total number of data. We want the normalization of any two compared sets to be the same (so, we scale accordingly). What numpy functions I used.

I definitely want to describe the Leuschner dish, some features in the signal chain, maybe just borrow the whole image and edit from there.

\section{Methods}

\quad \quad To observe the galactic plane, we have our trusty tracking script. After three labs' worth of development, it is almost correct!

We convert from galactic to topocentric coordinates using rotation matrices, as described in a previous report. How much should I include? If I describe the matrices again, that will certainly have to go in the introduction.

We probably want a basic run-down of a .fits file, but perhaps some of that can go in the introduction.

The Leuschner dish did not automatically report the frequency axis, \textcolor{red}{I think}. I should describe how I went from .fits file to calibrated spectrum (this includes determining the frequency axis).

% index value 4081 is the unshifted hydrogen line
% I went back and rewatched a bit of the first lecture for the lab where he was talking about the telescope since I figured it was an instrumentation thing and he mentioned at one point that each channel is about 10k Hz
% and the bandwidth starts at 1.4GHz
% then, taking into account frequency doubling, 1.42GHz turned into roughly index value 4081

\section{Observations}

\quad \quad What would be a good $introduction$ to the data? We have hundreds of raw spectra. I am not sure how to $succinctly$ describe observations before we get into the analysis.

\section{Analysis}

\quad \quad I should explain the process of taking a spectrum to a point on our galactic plane map (Doppler shift calculations, then orthographic projection). 

\section{Conclusions}

\quad \quad We seem to have at least a couple of results! How do I estimate the uncertainty on the Leuschner dish?
